    "In the <a href=\"http://michael-harmon.com/posts/sentimentanalysis1\">first part</a> of this two part blog post I went over the basics of ETL with PySpark and MongoDB.  In this second part I will go over the actual machine learning aspects of sentiment analysis using <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html\">SparkML</a> (aka MLlib, it seems the name is changing).  Specifically, we'll be using <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html\">ML Pipelines</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression\">Logistic Regression</a> to build a basic linear classifier for sentiment analysis. Many people use Support Vector Machines (SVM) because they handle high dimensional data well (which NLP problems definitely are) and allow for the use of non-linear kernels.  However, given the number of samples in our dataset and the fact Spark's <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.2/ml-classification-regression.html#linear-support-vector-machine\">SVM</a> only supports linear Kernels (which have comparable performance to logistic regression) I decided to just stick with the simpler model, aka logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we build a baseline model for sentiment analysis, I'll introduce techniques to improve performance like removing stop words and using N-grams. I also introduce a custom Spark <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/ml-guide.html#transformers\">Transformer</a> class that uses the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\">NLTK</a> to perform stemming.  Lastly, we'll review <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-tuning.html\">hyper-parameter tunning</a> with cross-validation to optimize our model. The point of this post *is not too build the best classifier on a huge dataset, but rather to show how to piece together advanced concepts using PySpark... and at the same time get reasonable results.*\n",
    "\n",
    "That said we will continue to use the 1.6 million <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140\">tweets</a> from Kaggle which I loaded into my <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas\">Atlas MongoDB</a> cluster with the Spark ETL job that was discussed in the previous <a href=\"http://michael-harmon.com/blog/SentimentAnalysisP1.html\">post</a>.  While 1.6 million tweets doesn't necessitate a distributed environment, using PySpark on this datset was a little too much for my whimpy 2013 Macbook Air and I needed to use a more powerful machine.  Luckily <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a> (GCP) gives everyone free credits to start using their platform and I was able to use Spark on a <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/\">Hadoop</a> cluster using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/\">dataproc</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datalab/\">datalab</a>. \n",

    "---------\n",
    "I have been using Hadoop and Spark for quite some time now, but have never spun up my own cluster and gained a new found respect for Hadoop admins.  While Google does make the process easier, I still had to ask a friend for help to get things to work the way I wanted them to.  Between getting the correct version of Python as well as the correct version of NLTK on both the driver and worker nodes, the correct MongoDB connection for PySpark 2.3.2 and the time it takes to spin up and spin down a cluster I was very much done configuting Hadoop clusters on my own.  I want to say that made me a better person or at least a better data scientist, but I'm not so sure. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "To start up the Hadoop cluster with two worker nodes (with the GCP free trial I could only use two worker nodes) I used the command below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/mdh266/TwitterSentimentAnalysis/blob/master/images/CreateCluster.png?raw=1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see dataproc image version, the string for the MongoDB connection, as well as the version of Python in the above commands.  The bash scripts that I reference in my Google storage bucket for this project can be obtain from my repo <a href=\"https://github.com/mdh266/SentimentAnalysis/tree/master/GCP\">here</a>.  After the cluster is created we can ssh onto the master node by going to the console and clicking on \"*Compute Engine*\" tab.  You will see a page like the one below:\n",

    "We can ssh on the master node using the ssh tab to the right of the instance named **mikescluster-m**.  The \"-m\" signifies it is the master node while the other instances have \"-w\" signifiying they are worker nodes. After connecting to the mater node you can see all the <a href=\"https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-hadoop-hdfs-commands-tutorial/\">Hadoop commands</a> available:\n",

    "\n",
    "We won't work on our Hadoop cluster through command line, but rather connect to the cluster through Jupyter notebooks using Google <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datalab/\">datalab</a>. To do this involves creating an ssh-tunnel and proxy for Chrome, both of which I had no idea how to do, but luckily the same friend from before walked me through it.  The bash scripts I used to do these last two procedures are located in my repo <a href=\"https://github.com/mdh266/SentimentAnalysis/tree/master/GCP\">here</a>. After those steps were completed we can enter the address into our web browser to see the Jupyter notebooks,\n",

    "Note that the notebooks are running on the master node using port 8080 and that <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html\">YARN</a> can be seen from the same web address, but using port 8088.  I'll come back to YARN a little later.  Now that we have our Hadoop cluster up and running on Google Cloud we can talk about how to access our data.\n",

In this post I won't go over the ETL process again, but will show how to connect PySpark to the Atlas cluster.  One thing to highlight here is that in order to keep my collection within the memory limits of the free tier I had to store the data as strings instead of tokens as I showed in the previous post. (See the ETL job here <a href=\"https://github.com/mdh266/SentimentAnalysis/blob/master/ETL/BasicETL.py\">here</a> for details)  Therefore we'll do have to tokenize our strings again here.\n",

We can give a formal defintion of the inverse-document-frequency by letting $\\mathcal{D}$ be the corpus or the set of all documents and $N_{\\mathcal{D}}$ is the number of documents in the corpus and $N_{t,D}$ be the number of documents that contain the term $t$ then, \n",

In order to pick up these types of combinations of words we introduce n-grams.  Bigrams combine consecutive pairs of words in our bag-of-words model.

    "In this two part blog post we went over how to perform Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) for NLP using Spark and MongoDB and then how to build a machine learning model for sentiment analysis using SparkML on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  In this post we focused on creating a machine learning model using <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html\">ML Pipelines</a> starting out with a basic model using TF-IDF and logistic regression. We added different stages to our ML Pipeline such as removing stop words, stemming and using bigrams to see which procedure would improve the predictive performance of our model. In the process we also went over how to write our own custom transformer in PySpark.  Once we settled on using stemming and bigrams in our model we performed a grid search using cross validation to obtain a model that has a AUC of 0.891 in the ROC curve and 81.5% accuracy which is not too shabby! One thing I didn't go over that is valuable is how to persist the ML Pipeline model to use again later without having to retrain, for that see <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html#ml-persistence-saving-and-loading-pipelines\">here</a>."
